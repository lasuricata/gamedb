GameDB The open-source games directory

OK First open-source project, and First git-based project. Let's see what happen.

I recently made a free online marketplace called LaSuricata, which has a nice AAA Game Database with most popular console games. The idea to use that DB as a start of a free-public-user-contributed-open-source game database, allowing anyone to commit a change (we will find the way to moderate) and anyone will be able to retrieve info using an API.

A long time ago since I started looking on open-source projects and this will be my 5 cents to the community. 

Welcome to this project, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any doubt.
